## 🛠️ **Quick Implementation Guide**

For each remaining page, follow this pattern:

### Step 1: Import Components
```tsx
import { DashboardSection } from "@/components/dashboard/DashboardSection";
import { IconName } from "lucide-react";
```

### Step 2: Update Spacing
```tsx
// Change from
<div className="space-y-6">

// To
<div className="space-y-8">
```

### Step 3: Wrap Sections
```tsx
// Before
<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Section Title</h2>
<div className="...">
  {/* Content */}
</div>

// After
<DashboardSection
  title="Section Title"
  description="Section description"
  icon={IconName}
  actions={<Button>Action</Button>}
>
  <div className="...">
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
</DashboardSection>
```

### Step 4: Add Icons
- Use appropriate icons from `lucide-react`
- Match icon to section purpose
- Use consistent icon styling

### Step 5: Test
- Verify all sections render correctly
- Test responsive design
- Check accessibility
- Validate functionality

---

## 📝 **Notes**

- All pages can use the same `DashboardSection` component pattern
- Icons should be consistent and meaningful
- Spacing should be `space-y-8` between sections
- Actions should be placed in section headers when appropriate
- Collapsible sections can be used for optional/advanced content

---

## ✅ **Next Steps**

1. **Start with High Priority pages** - Loans Management section
2. **Apply consistent pattern** - Use DashboardSection component
3. **Test each page** - Validate functionality and responsiveness
4. **Iterate based on feedback** - Refine as needed
